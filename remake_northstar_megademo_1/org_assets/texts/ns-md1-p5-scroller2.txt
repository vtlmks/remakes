FORM WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM NORTH STAR INC........    
THIS STORY WAS INSPIRED BY THE WARHAMMER FANTASY ROLEPLAY
AND WARHAMMER 40,000. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND A BIG THANX TO GAMES WORKSHOP
FOR PRODUCING SUCH GREAT GAMES.
THE STORY BEGINS......
THE SPACEMARINE SLOWLY OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED INSIDE.
THE ROOM WAS ALMOST EMPTY, EXCEPT FOR A SEEMINGLY LIFELESS BODY ON THE
FLOOR. HE CAREFULLY DREW CLOSER MAKING NO SOUND.
THE BODY WERE CLAD IN A BLUE ARMOURSUIT WITH THE ULTRAMARINES
SIGN PAINTED WHITE ON THE SHOULDER. WAIT A MINUTE! THERE WERE ALSO
SOME TEXT. IT READ: LOOK HERE TO DIE! -MY GOD! HE THOUGHT.
-NICKY, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU! HE SLOWLY SAID.
THE ARMOUR HAD BEEN PIERCED BY A LASERBEAM IN THE STOMACH AREA.
HE TOOK OFF THE HELMET TO LOOK IF HE WAS ALIVE.
HE WASN'T. HE PRESSED A BUTTON IN THE HELMET. AN ELECTRONIC
DEVICE HAD MADE A RECORDING OF NICKY'S LAST THOUGHTS.
-MIKE, GET THEM FOR MEEEEEAAAGHHH!!!   -I WILL.
HE RELEASED NICKY'S BOLTER FROM THE BELT. -THEY WILL DIE, WITH A
WARM GREETING FROM YOU! MIKE STOOD UP, LISTENING. THERE IT WAS.
A SOUND FROM A NEARBY ROOM. READYING THE BOLTER HE WALKED FORWARD
TO THE DOOR. APPARENTLY THEY WEREN'T EXPECTING COMPANY.
THE DOOR WASN'T CLOSED. HE SLAMMED IT OPEN, SCREAMING IN A DEEP
VOICE, -DIE MOTHER-FUCKERS !!! ,LETTING THE BOLTER SPREAD
HOT ARMOURPIERCING MISSILES OVER THE TWO CRIMINALS.
ONE SHOT WOULD HAVE DONE IT. THEY GOT TWENTY.         EACH!
MIKE DROPPED THE BOLTER AND REACHED FOR HIS POWER-SWORD
FASTENED ON HIS BACK. AS HE PULLED OUT THE BLADE, IT WAS ACTIVATED
AND HE SWIFTLY CUT OFF THE CRIMS HEADS, PUT THE SWORD BACK AND FASTENED
THE HEADS TO THE BELT. HE WOULD NEED THE HEADS TO PROVE THAT HE HAD
ELIMINATED HIS DEADLY PREY, AND IT WAS MUCH EASIER THAN CARRYING THE
BODIES. MIKE BLACK WAS HIS NAME. HE WAS WORKING AS AN IMPERIAL BOUNTYHUNTER.
HE DECIDED TO BECOME A HUNTER WHEN TWO FUCKING CRIMS KILLED HIS
PARENTS. HE WAS THE BEST. THERE WAS NO CRIM ALIVE THAT NOT FEARED HIM.
THE METHODS HE SOMETIMES USED WAS BLOODSHILLING EVEN FOR THE MOST
HARDENED CRIMINAL. TEN YEARS OF HUNTING HAD LEARNED HIM A LOT.
IN THE BEGINNING HE, AS MANY OTHERS, HAD MADE SOME MISTAKES, BUT HE
LEARNED FAST AND AFTER ONE YEAR THEY COULD GIVE HIM A NAME, A PICTURE
AND TELL HIM WHERE THE CRIM WAS LAST SEEN AND THEN HE WOULD GET THEM!
NO MISTAKES MADE! BUT NOW HE'S HUNTIN' DAYS WERE OVER.
ALL THAT KILLING HAD MADE HIS FEELINGS AGAINST MURDERERS AND DRUG
PUSHERS TURN TO HATE BUT FOR A SPECIAL GIRL HE MET SOME YEARS AGO
THEY WERE REVERSED. HE WAS GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK!!
EVEN THE THOUGHT OF HER MADE HIS BODY GO ALL NOVAHOT!
THIS WAS THE LAST MISSION AND NOW HE WOULD RETIRE TO A MORE PEACEFUL
JOB - ASSASSIN-TRAINER. HE WOULDN'T GET KILLED ANYWAY, EVEN IF IT
WAS VERY HARD FOR THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST.
MOST OF THEM AIN'T AROUND TO TELL ABOUT IT.
- AN HOUR LATER, AT HQ. MIKE FLEW THE SPACEHOPPER LIKE AN ACE.
HE'D OWNED IT FOR TWO YEARS AND KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW IT BEHAVED
IN THE AIR, OR SPACE FOR THAT MATTER. - HANGAR OPEN MIKE! FLY RIGHT IN!
THE COMMANDS CAME OVER THE SHORT RANGE INTERCOM. MIKE DIVED THE 5000 FEET
DOWN AND LEVELED OUT TO STOP AT TWO FEET - ALL IN TWO SECONDS - AND
SLOWLY CAME TO A HALT IN THE HANGAR. WHEN HE GOT OUT A MAN WAS RUSHING
TOWARDS HIM. -YO! MIKE! HEARD THE LATEST! -NO! WHAT! -THOSE TRAITORS
THAT YOU CATCHED LAST WEEK DID ESCAPE, KILLING EVERYBODY IN THE PRISON,
AND I MEAN EVERYBODY!!! -ALL? PRISONERS TOO? -YEP! -WOW! WHY DO THAT?
-BEATS ME. -WELL, THEY'RE NOT MY PROBLEM. I'M GETTING MARRIED, SO I'LL
QUIT HUNTING. -ARE YOU SERIOUS? -YOU HAVEN'T MET BELINDA HAVE YOU.
-NO. -IF YOU HAD YOU'D KNOWN WHAT I MEAN BY BEING SERIOUS.
-LUCKY GUY! -YEP! THE HANGAR LOUDSPEAKERS BURST TO LIFE, -BLACK HUNTER
TO COMMANDER NELSON, ON THE DOUBLE. -OOPS. GOTTA RUN! SEE YOU!
-SEE YOU TOO! DON'T FORGET TO INVITE ME TO THE WEDDING! -I WON'T!
         TEN SECONDS LATER.
-AAH! MIKE! WELCOME BACK. STILL COLLECTING HEADS I CAN SEE.
-YEP. NOT SO MUCH TO CARRY. ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE DEAD.
-I SUPPOSE THAT JACK DID TELL YOU ABOUT THE CRIMSON TRAITORS.
-YEP. YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME KILL THEM INSTEAD OF JUST BRINGING THEM IN.
NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO DO WITHOUT ME. -BUT MIKE! YOU'RE OUR BEST!
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU WANT TO QUIT JUST FOR SOME GIRL WANTS TO GET
MARRIED. -SHE AIN'T JUST SOME GIRL. KEEP HER OUT OF THIS.
YOU'VE AGREED TO THIS EARLIER. NOW IT IS TOO LATE.
I WILL CONTINUE TO TRAIN YOUR ASSASSINS, THOUGH I WANT SOME
OF THOSE JOKAERO DIGITAL WEAPONS. -OK. I'LL GET THEM FOR YOU.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE. I'LL HAVE TO GET SOMEONE TO FIND CRIMSON
AND HIS TWO BODYGUARDS. NELSON REACHED FOR THE PHONE AS MIKE TURNED
AND WALKED OUT. HE WALKED DOWN TO THE HOPPER AND FLEW HOME.
NO MORE HUNTING. IT FELT STRANGE. LIKE IF SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
AT LAST. HOME. HE GOT OUT OF THE CHOPPER AND WALKED OVER TO THE HOUSE.
SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THE DINO-DOG THEY HAD AS WATCH-DOG WOULD HAVE COME TO
MEET HIM BY NOW. IT ALWAYS DID! HE REACHED TO THE BELT AND PULLED OUT
THE MELTA-GUN. IF ANYONE COULD STOP A DINO-DOG THEN THIS ANYONE MUST BE
VERY LETHAL. THE MELTA-GUN CAN STOP ANYTHING WITHIN A SHORT RANGE.
HE WALKED ROUND THE HOUSE. THERE WAS THE DOG. DEAD ALLRIGHT.
HEAD BLASTED OFF. PROBABLY BY A PLASMABLAST. SHIT! BELINDA!
HE RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE, FORGETTING TO BE CAREFUL.
AS HE DID SO, HE TRIGGERED A SENSOR THAT ACTIVATED A KILLER DROID
INSIDE. MIKE FIRED A BURST OF NOVA HEAT AT THE DROIDS HEAD AND IT
INSTANTLY MELTED TO NOTHING. SUDDENLY CRIMSON STOOD IN THE CENTER
OF THE ROOM, LAUGHING. -HA HA HA, I DIDN'T THINK THAT THE DROID WOULD
KILL YOU. YOU'RE TOO GOOD. BUT NOW I HAVE SOMETHING THAT WILL KEEP
YOU OFF MY BACK. I HAVE YOUR FEMALE. IF I GET ANY SIGN THAT YOU ARE AFTER ME
- THEN SHE IS DEAD. HA HA HA!!! CRIMSON STARTED TO FLICKER AND
BEGIN FROM THE BEGINNING. IT WAS A HOLO-MESSAGE. -DAMN YOU, CRIMSON,
HE SCREAMED.
YOU ARE DEAD, DO YOU HEAR ME, YOU ARE DEAD !!!
I'LL KILL YOU VERY, VERY SLOW. I SWEAR I CANNOT DIE UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD!!!
AFTER A MINUTE MIKE HAD RELAXED AND BECAME MYSTERIOUSLY CALM.
WHAT CRIMSON DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT BELINDA HAD A WAVE BEACON
SURGICALLY INPLANTED IN HER BRAIN. SO DID MIKE. HE COULD 'SEE'
WHERE SHE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS HEADING. AND SHE COULD 'SEE' HIM COME.
- IF SHE WEREN'T ALREADY DEAD.
MIKE PRESSED A HIDDEN BUTTON AND A PART OF THE FLOOR MOVED ASIDE,
REVEALING A STAIRWAY DOWN TO A CONTROL AND WEAPONRY ROOM.
HE WENT DOWN AND OPENED A DRAWER, TOOK OUT A PACKAGE AND CLOSED THE
DRAWER AGAIN. IN THE PACKAGE THERE WERE A SYN-SKIN SUIT. HE CHANGED
HIS CLOTHES TO THE SYN-SKIN.
IT WAS A SUIT WHEN ACTIVATED ABSORBED ALL LIGHT THAT HIT
IT. YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE OUTLINE OF THE COMPLETELY BLACK SUIT.
IT ALSO ENHANCED ALL SENSES. ONCE CHANGED HE PULLED OUT A SMALL NEEDLE
FROM THE PACKAGE. IT WAS POLYMORPHINE. WITH THIS DRUG HE COULD COMPLETELY
CHANGE SHAPE FOR TWO DAYS. THIS DRUG WAS A WELL KEPT SECRET AMONG
THE ASSASSINS. IT WAS ALSO VERY RARE. HE INJECTED THE DRUG AND
STARTED TO CONCENTRATE. LONG WHITE HAIR INSTEAD OF BLACK.
COMPLETELY BLACK EYES. AND THE FACE A LITTLE BIT THINNER.
THAT WOULD DO. WEARING HIS OLD WEAPONBELT HE OPENED A CLOSET.
IT WAS FILLED WITH WEAPONS. THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS.
HE TOOK ONE FLAMER. A SHORT RANGE WEAPON. VERY EFFECTIVE.
A BOLTER COULD ALSO BECOME HANDY. A NEEDLE GUN FOR SILENT SHOOTING.
AND OF COURSE THE POWER SWORD. JOKAERO WEAPONS WAS IN THIS LITTLE BOX.
HE HAD EIGHT LASERS. WHEN PUT ON A FINGER THEY WHERE INVISIBLE.
HE TOOK ALL AND WENT OUT TO THE HOPPER. AT 10,000 FEET HE SENSED BELINDA.
HE SHOULD HEAD SOUTH. ACTIVATED THE AUTOPILOT AND STARTED TO PUT ON
THE FINGERLASERS.      IN THE CITY OF CREO SHE WAS.  -HEY CRIMSON!
THAT LADY YOU INSISTED THAT WE WOULD TAKE ALONG JUST CUT OFF CAL'S
LEFT ARM WITH THIS! HE WAS HOLDING A LASERNEEDLE. -DON'T WORRY,
IT WILL GROW OUT SOON. I DIDN'T CHOOSE YOU BEQAUSE YOU ARE PRETTY
, YOU KNOW. MORPHS ARE GOOD TO HAVE AROUND. - WELL I HAD TO PUT HER INTO
THE STASIS BOX FOR NOW. -IT'S OK! THAT WILL AT LEAST KEEP HER STILL.
AS HE SAID SO, MIKE STEPPED IN. -YOU ARE CRIMSON! -SO WHAT?
-LOOKING FOR NEW MEN? -WHAT IF I DID? -I AM GOOD. -THEN KILL MIKE BLACK
FOR ME. -I DON'T GO ON SUICIDE MISSIONS.   THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM
ANYWAY. NOW HE MUST FIND BELINDA AND TAKE IT FROM THERE.
-WELL FOLLOW ME DOWN AND WE WILL DISCUSS MATTERS. DAK, SHOW HIM THE WAY.-YO
SIR!    MIKE WENT AHEAD.
 AS HE TURNED A BEND HE SWITCHED ON THE SYNSKIN.
HE DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW. -WHAT! HE DISAPPEARED.     THE SHAPESHIFTER
DRUG STOPPED WORKING AND HE DID LOOK AS USUAL THOUGH STILL INVISIBLE IN
THE DARK PASSAGEWAYS HE PULLED THE BOLTER AND SHOT DAK STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE HEART. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO KILL A MORPH.
HE DECENDED FURTHER DOWN AND FOUND CAL, SITTING IN THE INFIRMARY.
 THE BOLTER SPEAKED AGAIN. CAL'S HEART HAD A DIFFICULT TIME AFTER THAT.
IT WAS RATHER COLD ON THE FLOOR. ESPECHIALLY FOR A HEART BLOWN APART
(HEY, THAT RHYMES!). A ROOM TO THE RIGHT SHE WAS HELD IN A STASIS FIELD.
MIKE SWITCHED OFF THE FIELD THAT HELD HER, TURNED OFF THE SYNSKIN.
-HELLO BELINDA, STILL GETTING MARRIED?   -I JUST HOPE THAT THIS ISN'T
GOING TO BE A HABIT THOUGH! GIMME THAT BLASTER. I WANT TO SHOOT CRIMSONS
HEAD CLEAN OFF! -SAVE THE HEAD. I NEED IT! -OH! HEADHUNTER AS YOU ARE.
-THIS IS THE LAST.         CRIMSON SLOWLY WALKED DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY,
KNOWING THAT HE WOULD SOON BE DEAD, BUT HE WOULD KILL THEM BOTH BEFORE HE
WENT HIMSELF. AS HE TURNED THE BEND HE SAW THEM. BELINDA KNEELING AND MIKE
STANDING BEHIND HER! BOTH POINTING RATHER LARGE WEAPONS A HIM.
 HE RAISED THE FLAMERPISTOL HE WAS CARRYING BUT HE WAS FAR TOO SLOW.
BELINDA HAD THE SAME TRAINING AS MIKE AND WHEN THEY SAW THE WEAPON THEY
RELEASED A MASSIVE WALL OF BULLETS, CUTTING AWAY PIECE AFTER PIECE.
THE HEAD CAME ROLLING TOWARDS THEM. A HUNTERS REWARD. A HEAD ON A PLATE.
THAT IS WHAT NELSON RECIEVED WHEN MIKE DROPPED BY TO COLLECT THE REWARD.
THEN MIKE AND BELINDA HAD A THREE DAY LONG WEDDING INVITING ALL HIS FRIENDS
AND THEN LIVED LONG AND HAPPILY. THEY HAD A SON. HE WOULD IN THE FUTURE
BECOME KNOWN AS JOHNNY BLACK - THE MOST DANGEROUS BOUNTY HUNTER
THAT EVER LIVED IN THE TIME OF THE EMPEROR             -THE END- ^
